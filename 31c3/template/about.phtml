	<h1>About the Live-Streams and Recordings</h1>
	<p>

		We are a group of enthusiasts running lecture recording and streaming infrastructure.

		Although the Licence permits it, we would like to ask you to <strong>not distribute Stream-Dumps</strong>. We try to release finished cuts of the videos as quick as possible at <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/index.html">media.ccc.de</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mediacccde">YouTube</a> and that early releases of incomplete stream dumps without audio-translation and subtitles and intros and unprocessed audio will not help anybody.
