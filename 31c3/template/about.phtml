	<h1>About the Live-Streams and Recordings</h1>
	<p>
		Lecture recording and streaming at 31st Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg is organized and performed by a joint venture of <a href="http://fem.tu-ilmenau.de">Forschungsgemeinschaft elektronische Medien e.V.</a>, <a href="http://www.ags.tu-bs.de/">Wissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Studio- und Senderfragen an der TU Braunschweig e.V.</a> and <a href="http://c3voc.de">Chaos Computer Club Video Operation Center</a>.

	<p>
		Although the licence permits it, we would like to ask you to <strong>don't distribute stream dumps</strong>. We try to release finished cuts of recordings as quickly as possible on <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/index.html">media.ccc.de</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mediacccde">YouTube</a>. Early releases of incomplete stream dumps without audio translation, subtitles, intros, <a href="https://auphonic.com/">unprocessed audio</a> and missing meta data information is not what we have in mind when we spend three month of preparation in our spare time.
