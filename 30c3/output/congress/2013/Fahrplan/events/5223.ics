DESCRIPTION:Memory corruption has been around forever but is still one of
  the most exploited problems on current systems. This talk looks at the 
 past 30 years of memory corruption and systematizes the different existi
 ng exploit and defense techniques in a streamlined way. We evaluate (i) 
 how the different attacks evolved\, (ii) how researchers came up with de
 fense mechanisms as an answer to new threats\, and (iii) what we will ha
 ve to expect in the future.
