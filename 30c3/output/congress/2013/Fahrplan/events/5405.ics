DESCRIPTION:For over thirty years\, human rights groups in Guatemala have
  carefully documented the killing and disappearance of many people in th
 e early 1980s. There are tens of thousands of records in many databases\
 , and over 80 million paper pages of police records available in the Arc
 hives of the National Police. Most of the prosecutions of the former mil
 itary and police officials who committed the atrocities depends on eyewi
 tnesses\, specific documents\, and forensic anthropologists' examination
  of exhumed bones. However\, data analysis helps to see the big patterns
  in the violence.
