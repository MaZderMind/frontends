DESCRIPTION:This talk will demonstrate why it is virtually impossible to 
 secure virtual machines implementations properly. In the talk I will try
  to give an overview of the basics of hardware virtualization technology
 \, the existing attack techniques against virtualization and also explai
 n why it is such a complex problem to create a secure hypervisor. The ta
 lk will focus on the low level interfaces and how it affects all aspects
  of computer platform security. I will also try to review a few interest
 ing Erratas at the end of the talk.
