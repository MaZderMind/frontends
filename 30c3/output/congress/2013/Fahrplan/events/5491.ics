DESCRIPTION:The news of the past few years is one small ripple in what is
  a great wave of culture and history\, a generational clash of civilizat
 ions.  If you want to understand why governments are acting and reacting
  the way they are\, and as importantly\, how to shift their course\, you
  need to understand what they're reacting to\, how they see and fail to 
 see the world\, and how power\, money\, and idea of rule of law actually
  interact.
