DESCRIPTION:Knight-Mozilla OpenNews sends coders into news organisations 
 on a ten-month fellowship to make new tools for reporting and measuring 
 the news. We believe that to remain relevant\, journalism has to smarten
  up about tech and data. As a global community\, we develop tools to dat
 amine public data\, news apps to make information accessible\, and visua
 lisations to break down complex stories. In my talk\, I want to present 
 the lessons about tech that I've learned in a newsroom and the things th
 at still need to be built.
