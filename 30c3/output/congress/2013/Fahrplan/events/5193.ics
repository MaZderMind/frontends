DESCRIPTION:In this talk (which in part was delivered at Infiltrate 2013 
 and NoSuchCon 2013) we will discuss our recent research that is being ro
 lled into our Practical ARM Exploitation course (sold out at Blackhat th
 is year and last) on Linux and Android (for embedded applications and mo
 bile devices). We will also demonstrate these techniques and discuss how
  we were able to discover them using several ARM hardware development pl
 atforms that we custom built.  Where relevant we will also discuss ARM e
 xploitation as it related to Android as we wrote about in the "Android H
 ackers Handbook" which we co-authored and will be released in October 20
 13.
