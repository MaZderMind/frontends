DESCRIPTION:As application security becomes more important on Android we 
 need better tools to analyze and understand them. Android applications a
 re written in Java and a run in the Dalvik VM. Until now most analysis i
 s done via disassembling and monitored execution in an emulator. This ta
 lk presents a new technique to instrument Android applications executed 
 in the DVM. The talk will introduce the new technique in great detail in
 cluding many small examples and a whole attack based on it. We will go s
 tep by step to show you what can be achieved using this technique.
