DESCRIPTION:23rd of December 2008 was a sad day in India for civil libert
 ies. On this day\, The Indian Parliament passed the "The Information Tec
 hnology (Amendment) Act" with no debate in the House\, which effectively
  means is that the government of India now has the power to monitor all 
 digital communications in the country without a court order or a warrant
 . The "world's largest democracy" strongly leaning towards becoming a su
 rveillance state raises many questions and poses severe challenges for f
 ree speech and economic justice in India and globally. This talk will ma
 p and review the current political\, socio-cultural and legal landscape 
 of mass-surveillance\, data protection and censorship in India and analy
 se how it ties in to the global landscape of surveillance and censorship
 . It will also aim to create a discussion space to investigate the deepe
 r effects of these so called "welfare" projects and how citizen-led move
 ments can drive the state towards stronger data protection and privacy l
 aws.
