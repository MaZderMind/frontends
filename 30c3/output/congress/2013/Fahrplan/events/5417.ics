DESCRIPTION:Side-channel analysis (SCA) and related methods exploit physi
 cal characteristics of a (cryptographic) implementations to bypass secur
 ity mechanisms and extract secret keys. Yet\, SCA is often considered a 
 purely academic exercise with no impact on real systems. In this talk\, 
 we show that this is not the case: Using the example of several wide-spr
 ead real-world devices\, we demonstrate that even seemingly secure syste
 ms can be attacked by means of SCA with limited effort.
