DESCRIPTION:Making a new control system for a machine is often a slow and
  tedious task. Maybe you already have a 3 axis stage\, and you already k
 now how to move it around. But what if you want to add a camera and use 
 it for position feedback? You'd have to redesign the whole hardware laye
 r. I'll talk about some ways I've built modularity into control systems 
 for machines so that you can quickly iterate on different kinds of machi
 ne systems without getting stuck in hardware land forever. This includes
  connecting synchronized nodes across a network and importing legacy nod
 es for things like\, say\, an old pressure box you found in the trash an
 d has rs232 in. Down with gcode! Long live machine control.
