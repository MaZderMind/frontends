DESCRIPTION:Supersymmetry has been particle theorists' favorite toy for s
 everal decades. It predicts a yet unobserved symmetry of nature and impl
 ies that to each known type of elementary particle there exists a partne
 r particle none of which has been detected up to today. \n\nI will expla
 in why it is  an attractive idea nevertheless and what is the current si
 tuation after the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN has looked at many
  places where supersymmetric partners were expected and did not find the
 m. Is it time to give up hope that susy is a property of nature?
