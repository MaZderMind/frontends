DESCRIPTION: 	Increasingly\, users and their computing hardware are expos
 ed a range of software and hardware attacks\, ranging from disk imaging 
 to hardware keylogger installation and beyond. Existing methods are inad
 equate to fully protect users\, particularly from covert physical hardwa
 re modifications in the "evil maid" scenario\, and yet are very inconven
 ient. Victims include governments and corporations traveling internation
 ally (e.g. China)\, anti-government activists in places like Syria\, and
  anyone who is a target of a motivated attacker who can gain physical ac
 cess.\n\nPhysically Unclonable Functions\, combined with a trusted mobil
 e device and a network service\, can be used to mitigate these risks. We
  present a novel open-source mobile client and network service which can
  protect arbitrary hardware from many forms of covert modification and a
 ttack\, and which when integrated with software\, firmware\, and policy 
 defenses\, can provide greater protection to users and limit potential a
 ttack surface.
