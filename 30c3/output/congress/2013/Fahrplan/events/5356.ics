DESCRIPTION:We present a collection of techniques which aim to automagica
 lly remove significant (and unnecessary) portions of firmware binaries f
 rom common embedded devices to drastically reduce the attack surface of 
 these devices. We present a brief theoretical explanation of Firmware Fa
 t Camp\, a collection of "before" and "after" photos of graduates of FFC
 \, along with a set of live demonstrations of FFC in action on common em
 bedded devices.\n\nModern embedded systems such as VoIP phones\, network
  printers and routers typically ship with all available features compile
 d into its firmware image. A small subset of these features is activated
  at any given time on individual devices based on its specific configura
 tion. An even smaller subset of features is actually used\, as some unus
 ed and insecure features cannot are typically enabled by default and can
 not be disabled. However\, all embedded devices still contain a large am
 ount of code and data that should never be executed or read according to
  its current configuration. This unnecessary binary is not simply a wast
 e of memory\; it contains vulnerable code and data that can be used by a
 n attacker to exploit the system. This “dead code” provides an ideal
  attack surface. Automated minimization of this attack surface will sign
 ificantly improve the security of the device without any impact to the d
 evice’s functionality.
