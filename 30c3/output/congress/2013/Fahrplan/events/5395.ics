DESCRIPTION:The brain can be understood as a highly specialized informati
 on processing device. Because computers basically do the same thing\, it
 's not too absurd to try to link these two together. The result is a bra
 in-computer-interface.\nThis talk explains the core functionality of our
  brain and how to access the stored data from the outside. Software and 
 hardware have already reached a somewhat hacker-friendly state\, and we 
 want to show you how we got there. We're also here to answer all your qu
 estions about the brain.
