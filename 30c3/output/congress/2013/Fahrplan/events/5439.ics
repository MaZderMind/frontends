DESCRIPTION:2013 will be remembered as the year that the Internet lost it
 s innocence for nearly everyone as light was shed on the widespread use 
 of dragnet surveillance by the NSA and intelligence agencies globally. W
 ith the uprisings of the Arab Spring where people raided the offices of 
 their regimes to bring evidence to light\, we've seen a tremendous pheno
 menon: a large numbers of whistleblowers have taken action to inform the
  public about important details. The WikiLeaks SpyFiles series also show
 s us important details to corroborate these claims. There is ample evide
 nce about the use and abuses of a multi-billion dollar industry that hav
 e now come to light. This evidence includes increasing use of targeted a
 ttacks to establish even more invasive control over corporate\, governme
 nt or other so-called legitimate targets.
