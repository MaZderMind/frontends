DESCRIPTION:The talk gives an overview about our work of quantifying know
 ledge acquisition tasks in real-life environments\, focusing on reading.
  We combine several pervasive sensing approaches (computer vision\, moti
 on-based activity recognition etc.) to tackle the problem of recognizing
  and classifying knowledge acquisition tasks with a special focus on rea
 ding. We discuss which sensing modalities can be used for digital and of
 fline reading recognition\, as well as how to combine them dynamically.
