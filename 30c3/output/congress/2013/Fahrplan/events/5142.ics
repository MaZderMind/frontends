DESCRIPTION:Software-Defined Radio (SDR) has increased in popularity in r
 ecent years due to the decrease in hardware costs and increase in proces
 sing power. One example of such a class of devices is the RTL-SDR USB do
 ngles based on the Realtek RTL2832U demodulator. This talk will discuss 
 my experience in building a distributed RF scanner array for monitoring 
 and spectrum mapping using such cheap SDR devices. The goal is to help t
 he audience understand the what\, why\, and how of building their own RF
  monitoring array so that they will be able to do it themselves. In this
  era of increasingly being ``watched''\, we must be prepared to do our o
 wn ``watching''.\n
