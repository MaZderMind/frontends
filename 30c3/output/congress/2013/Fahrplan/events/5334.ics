DESCRIPTION:In this lecture\, we present a black-box analysis of an elect
 ronic contact-less system that has been steadily\nreplacing a convention
 al mechanical key on multi-party\nhouses in a big European city. So far\
 , there are est. 10.000 installations of the electronic system. The mech
 anical key has been introduced about 40 years ago to allow mail delivery
  services to access multi-party houses but has since then aggregated man
 y additional users\, such as garbage collection\, police\, fire brigade 
 and other emergency services. Over 92% of residential buildings in this 
 city are equipped with such a solution.
