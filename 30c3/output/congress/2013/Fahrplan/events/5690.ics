DESCRIPTION:BarbNerdy is not only nerdy in finding great music all over t
 he places\, she is also writing wonderful stories with them. . In Berlin
  she is doing since 2009  the very open minded and bass music focussed S
 upport Your Local Ghetto nights at the lovely Panke with a lot of local 
 but also international guests. \nShe started DJ'ing in 1990\, worked wit
 h people from the first techno generation like DJ Hell\, Blake Baxter or
  Abe Duque but already in 1996 she got bored of the 4/4 and jumped out o
 f this strict costume and enjoyed even more new music before this hits t

 ssion. Give her a good sound system and she will guide you through a unf
 orgettable journey of music.
