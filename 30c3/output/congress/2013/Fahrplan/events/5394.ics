DESCRIPTION:Software engineering is in a unsustainable state: software is
  mainly developed in a trial and error fashion\, which always leads to v
 ulnerable systems. Several decades ago the correspondence between logics
  and programming (Curry-Howard) was found. This correspondence is now be
 ing used in modern programming languages using dependent types\, such as
  Agda\, Coq\, and Idris.\n\nIn this talk I show our development of attac
 ks and security notions within Agda\, using the recent <a href="https://
 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH_%28security_exploit%29">BREACH</a> exploit 
 as an example. Our development is a constructive step towards verified s
 oftware and bridges a gap between theory and practice.\nI will explain t
 he details about the Curry-Howard correspondence.\nThe target audience a
 re interested people with some programming experience.
