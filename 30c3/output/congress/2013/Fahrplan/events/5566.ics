DESCRIPTION:This is a call for participation in a project aimed to build 
 up an open source based experimental incubator which can be used for var
 iety of food\, beverage and bio hacking projects allowing for easy contr
 ol and monitoring of internal condition like temperature and humidity. W
 orking groups will be established to develop prototypes which can be eas
 ily and relatively cheaply assembled. Securing funding and establishing 
 a portal to effectively share the news and knowledge within the groups a
 nd wider community will be major part of the first phase.
