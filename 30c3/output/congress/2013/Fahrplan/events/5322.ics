DESCRIPTION:A year ago in November 2012\, Nintendo released their latest 
 home video game console: the Wii U. While most video game consoles use c
 ontrollers that are very basic\, the Wii U took the opposite route with 
 a very featureful gamepad: wireless with a fairly high range\, touch scr
 een\, speakers\, accelerometer\, video camera\, and even NFC are support
 ed by the Wii U gamepad. However\, as of today\, this interesting piece 
 of hardware can only be used in conjunction with a Wii U: wireless commu
 nications are encrypted and obfuscated\, and there is no documentation a
 bout the protocols used for data exchange between the console and its co
 ntroller. Around december 2012\, I started working with two other hacker
 s in order to reverse engineer\, document and implement the Wii U gamepa
 d communication protocols on a PC. This talk will present our findings a
 nd show the current state of our reverse engineering efforts.
