DESCRIPTION:Law enforcement agencies claim they are "going dark". Encrypt
 ion technologies have finally been deployed by software companies\, and 
 critically\, enabled by default\, such that emails are flowing over HTTP
 S\, and disk encryption is now frequently used. Friendly telcos\, who we
 re once a one-stop-shop for surveillance can no longer meet the needs of
  our government. What are the FBI and other law enforcement agencies doi
 ng to preserve their spying capabilities? \n\n
