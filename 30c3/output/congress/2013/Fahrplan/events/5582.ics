DESCRIPTION:SCADA StrangeLove team will present their research on ICS sys
 tems for the second time on CCC. Last year we showed current situation w
 ith security of industrial world and disclosed a big number of vulnerabi
 lities found in Siemens ICS solutions. Part of vulnerabilities\, we can 
 say most notable one\, wasn’t disclosed due to Responsible Disclosure.
  This time we already know. We will speak about several industrial proto
 cols and their weaknesses. During this year we played with new industria
 l hardware and software – this patitially brings new “We don’t kno
 w yet” vulnerability details. Moreover\, we’ll mention creepiest bug
 s undisclosed from last year\, tell you about new ones and build attack 
 vectors from them. At last\, we will share our experience in pentesting 
 ICS enviroments.\n\nSpeakers: Gleb Gritsai and Sergey Gordeychik
