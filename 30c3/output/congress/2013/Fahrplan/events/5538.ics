DESCRIPTION:As Internet privacy/security professionals and amateur enthus
 iasts\, we are often asked to give advice about best practices in this f
 ield. Sometimes this takes the form of one-on-one advice to our friends\
 , sometimes it's training a room full of people\, and sometimes you may 
 be asked to write a blog post or a brief guide or an entire curriculum. 
 This talk will survey the current Internet privacy guide landscape and d
 iscuss the perils and pitfalls of creating this type of resource\, using
  the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Surveillance Self Defense project 
 as a case study.
