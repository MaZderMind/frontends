DESCRIPTION:About a year ago Nintendo released their latest video gaming 
 console\, the Wii U. Since 2006\, the Wii has led to one of the most act

 his talk will discuss the improvements made in Wii U's architecture and 
 explain how it was broken in less than 31 days. The talk is targeted at 
 those who hack (or design) embedded system security\, but gamers might a
 lso find it interesting.
