DESCRIPTION:All “managed FLASH” devices\, such as SD\, microSD\, and 
 SSD\, contain an embedded controller to assist with the complex tasks ne
 cessary to create an abstraction of reliable\, contiguous storage out of
  FLASH silicon that is fundamentally unreliable and unpredictably fragme
 nted. This controller is an attack surface of interest. First\, the abil
 ity to modify the block allocation and erasure algorithms introduces the
  opportunity to perform various MITM attacks in a virtually undetectable
  fashion. Second\, the controller itself is typically powerful\, with pe
 rformance around 50MIPS\, yet with a cost of mere pennies\, making it an
  interesting and possibly useful development target for other non-storag
 e related purposes. Finally\, understanding the inner workings of the co
 ntroller enables opportunities for data recovery in cards that are thoug
 ht to have been erased\, or have been partially damaged.\n\nThis talk de
 monstrates a method for reverse engineering and loading code into the mi
 crocontroller within a SD memory card.
