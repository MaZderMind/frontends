DESCRIPTION:The use of encryption to secure sensitive data from unauthori
 zed eyes is as old as human communication itself. Before the relatively 
 new method of computerized encryption software converting data into a fo
 rmat unintelligible to anyone lacking the necessary key for its decrypti
 on\, for a long time there was pen and paper and the human brain doing q
 uite a bit of work. Up until the 20th century encryption had to be done 
 literally by hand\, to then be transmitted in paper form\, via telegraph
 y or radio. In this context\, encryption of data has always been of spec
 ial importance during times of political conflict and war\; subsequently
 \, it saw its major developments during those times in history. This tal
 k will examine and explain common hand encryption methods still employed
  today using the example of one very successful Soviet espionage group o
 perating in Japan in the 1930s and 1940s: the spy ring centered around R
 ichard Sorge\, codenamed “Ramsay”.
