DESCRIPTION:The average movement habits of a clichè hacker are legendary
 . Cowering for days in front of unergonomic hardware setups\, stoic igno
 rance of hardly decodeable signs of the body like hunger\, eye- and back
 pains. Probably due to a general disinterest in non-digitally engineered
  systems.\n\nShouldn’t a true hacker know at least bits and pieces abo
 ut the codes and signs of the body? We all know bits and pieces.. but ar
 e they the correct and helpful ones? We will discuss some technical and 
 biological details of slipped discs\, posture disservice and pain. I wil
 l show fundamental “red flags” which have to be serviced by a medica
 l geek. But not all medical geeks have a good idea about the body's code
 \, therefore I will also suggest some helpful therapies for the most com
 mon cases.\nBottom line: how to code your body to prevent pain without r
 elying on smattering.\n
