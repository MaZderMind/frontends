<h2>lecture: Open source experimental incubator build up</h2>
<h3 class="title">call for participation in project and product development</h3>

<div class="image large"><img alt="Experimental_incubator_c_base_800_2012" src="/congress/2013/Fahrplan/system/logos/5566/large/experimental_incubator_c_base_800_2012.jpg"></div>
<p class="abstract">This is a call for participation in a project aimed to build up an open source based experimental incubator which can be used for variety of food, beverage and bio hacking projects allowing for easy control and monitoring of internal condition like temperature and humidity. Working groups will be established to develop prototypes which can be easily and relatively cheaply assembled. Securing funding and establishing a portal to effectively share the news and knowledge within the groups and wider community will be major part of the first phase.</p>
<p class="description">One of the basic devices needed for experimenting with growth of variety of microbes for many different purposes ranging from bio luminescence art, magic mushrooms or to more frequently persuaded food and beverage fermentation is incubator. Ranging from the fields of extreme hard core bio-hacking to traditional home experimentation, device where one can easily control some of it’s internal conditions like for example temperature or humidity and record corresponding data is needed. Decently priced well established and supported open source version is not available yet. The aim of this project is to establish product which is developed by people and groups interested in the subject and which is shared by the community based on the open source paradigm and importantly continuously developed, so upgrade and update of future generations is secured. The long term goal is development of easy to assembly kit’s and complete device which people interested in can buy (from variety of entities, open source).</p>

<p class="description">This talk will be “officially” launching this project announcing it to the wider community calling for participation. The basic goals, budgeting and concepts for the first year or so will be established already, anticipating participation of people interested in, giving for sure some space for changes because of new people being involved. The short time goal will be to establish several working groups participating more intensively in design of first prototypes, securing funding for this effort and also building proper portal to share the news on development. For more details check our pages, this project will be quite intensively developed in the next few months, after few years of relative hibernation.</p>
