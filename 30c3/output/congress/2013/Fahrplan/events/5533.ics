DESCRIPTION:Internet-wide network scanning has powerful security applicat
 ions\, including exposing new vulnerabilities\, tracking their mitigatio
 n\, and exposing hidden services.  Unfortunately\, probing the entire pu
 blic address space with standard tools like Nmap requires either months 
 of time or large clusters of machines.  In this talk\, I'll demonstrate 
 <a href="https://zmap.io">ZMap</a>\, an open-source network scanner deve
 loped by my research group that is designed from the ground up to perfor
 m Internet-wide scans efficiently.  We've used ZMap with a gigabit Ether
 net uplink to survey the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes f
 rom a single machine\, more than 1300 times faster than Nmap.  I'll expl
 ain how ZMap's architecture enables such high performance.  We'll then w
 ork through a series of practical examples that explore the security app
 lications of very fast Internet-scale scanning\, both offensive and defe
 nsive.  I'll talk about results and experiences from conducting more tha
 n 300 Internet-wide scans over the past 18 months\, including new revela
 tions about the state of the HTTPS CA ecosystem.  I'll discuss the react
 ions our scans have generated--on one occasion we were mistaken for an I
 ranian attack against U.S. banks and we received a visit from the FBI--a
 nd I'll suggest guidelines and best practices for good Internet citizens
 hip while scanning.
