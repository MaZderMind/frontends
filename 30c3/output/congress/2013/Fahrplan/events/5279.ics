DESCRIPTION:You might remember Tamagotchi virtual pets from the 1990's. T
 hese toys are still around and just as demanding as ever! At 29C3\, I ta
 lked about my attempts to reverse engineer the latest Tamagotchis\, and 
 this presentation covers my progress since then. It includes methods for
  executing code on and dumping code from a Tamagotchi\, an analysis of t
 he Tamagotchi code dump and a demonstration of Tamagotchi development to
 ols that make use of these capabilities.
