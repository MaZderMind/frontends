DESCRIPTION:Few hackers will disagree that users are not given enough con
 sideration when building Internet Freedom Tools designed to circumvent c
 ensorship and surveillance. But how do we do it? This talk will outline 
 a framework for a user-focused approach to the Development and Impact of
  Internet Freedom Tools through using ethnography\, human-centered desig
 n\, and the practice of research-based product definition. This talk is 
 intended for developers\, researchers\, and journalists who seek to unde
 rstand how better tools can be developed to protect anonymity and provid
 e unfettered access to the Internet.
