DESCRIPTION:In the chain of trust of most secure schemes is an electronic
  chip that holds secret information. These schemes often employ cryptogr
 aphically secure protocols. The weakest link of such a scheme is the chi
 p itself. By attacking the chip directly an attacker can gain access to 
 the secret data in its unencrypted form. In this presentation we demonst
 rate the attack class of the future\, backside attacks. This class of at
 tacks mitigate all device countermeasures and can access all signals of 
 the device. As opposed to the attacks of today\, these attacks can also 
 be applied to complex systems such as the ARM SoCs of modern smartphones
