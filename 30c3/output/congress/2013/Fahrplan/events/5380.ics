DESCRIPTION:In this work we present a stealthy malware that exploits dedi
 cated hardware on the target system and remains persistant across boot c
 ycles. The malware is capable of gathering valuable information such as 
 passwords. Because the infected hardware can perform arbitrary main memo
 ry accesses\, the malware can modify kernel data structures and escalate
  privileges of processes executed on the system.\n\nThe malware itself i
 s a DMA malware implementation referred to as DAGGER. DAGGER exploits In
 tel’s Manageability Engine (ME)\, that executes firmware code such as 
 Intel’s Active Management Technology (iAMT)\, as well as its OOB netwo
 rk channel. We have recently improved DAGGER’s capabilites to include 
 support for 64-bit operating systems and a stealthy update mechanism to 
 download new attack code.
