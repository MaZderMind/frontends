DESCRIPTION:The <a href="http://www.arduguitar.org">ArduGuitar</a> is an 
 electric guitar with <i>no physical controls\,</i> i.e. no buttons or kn
 obs to adjust volume\, tone or to select the pickups. All of these funct
 ions are performed remotely via a bluetooth device such as an Android ph
 one\, or via a dedicated Arduino powered blutetooth footpedal. The music
 ian still plucks the strings\, of course! This talk will give an overvie
 w of the technology and particularly the voyage that took me from nearly
  no knowledge about anything electronic to enough know-how to make it al
 l work.I will explain what I learned by collaborating on forums\, with H
 ackerspaces and with component providers: "How to ask the right question
 s." The guitar with its Arduino powered circuit and an Android tablet wi
 ll be available for demo\; the code is all available on the github <a hr
 ef="https://github.com/gratefulfrog/ArduGuitar">arduguitar repo</a> with
  the associated <a href="https://github.com/gratefulfrog/lib">Arduino fo
 otpedal libraries</a>.
