<p class="abstract">I'm an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Michigan.  <a href="https://jhalderm.com">My research</a> focuses on computer security and privacy, with an emphasis on problems that broadly impact society and public policy. Topics that interest me include software security, network security, data privacy, anonymity, electronic voting, censorship resistance, digital rights management, computer forensics, ethics, and cybercrime. I'm also interested in the interaction of technology with law, governmental regulation, and international affairs.</p>
<p class="description">J. Alex Halderman is an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan.  His research focuses on computer security and privacy, with an emphasis on problems that broadly impact society and public policy.  He is well known for developing the "cold boot" attack against disk encryption, which altered widespread thinking on security assumptions about the behavior of RAM, influenced computer forensics practice, and inspired the creation of a new subfield of theoretical cryptography.  A noted expert on electronic voting security, he helped lead the first independent review of the election technology used by half a billion voters in India, which prompted the national government to undertake major technical reforms.  In recent work, he exposed widespread flaws in public key generation that compromised the security of 5-10% of Internet hosts serving HTTPS and SSH.  His work has won numerous distinctions, including two best paper awards from the Usenix Security conference.  He received his Ph.D. in computer science in 2009 from Princeton.</p>
